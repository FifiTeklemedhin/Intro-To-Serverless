*Managing a server is pretty complicated, and building with serverless architectures simplifies this process. As a student, mastering serverless functions can help you to build projects that solve real-world problems by integrating APIs, constructing user interfaces, and analysing data. Javascript is the core language of this course - one of the most in-demand languages to learn in the industry.*

* Azure Functions
* Twilio
* Implement a CosmosDB database
    * Learn about NoSQL databases and data structures
    * Store data with documents
    * Code functions to work with databases

### **Week 4** - Building a Frontend

Create a frontend for DeepSecrets API
Code a rudimentary frontend with HTML, CSS, and JS for the Deep Secrets API. 

* Code a rudimentary frontend with HTML, CSS, and JS
    * Code and style a page
    * Integrate JS that makes a POST request to the HTTP Triggers
* Visualize emotion data
    * Integrate the data stored in the CosmosDB database
    * Visualize the emotion data retrieved from the Face API

## :zap: Build your Own Project (Week 5-8)

### ‚úîÔ∏è After completing the cabin, students will create their own app with this timeline:
> ### **Week 5** - Brainstorming & Proposals ‚õà
> Students will submit a final project proposal which should outline, at a high level, what their project will be. This includes a project flowchart that shows the different components of the project and how they will interact with one another.
> 
> ### **Week 6** - Developing the MVP üíª
> Students will be presenting their MVPs next week and will be working with their instructors and mentors to develop their projects over the course of the next 2 weeks.
> 
> ### **Week 7** - Completing the MVP
> Students should have an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of the final project. This should be a bare bones version of the project with the most basic functionality working.
> 
> ### **Week 8** - Finalizing & Adding Features üéÄ
> Students will continue adding features and building their project until it is fully complete.
> 
> ### **Week 9** - Final Presentations 
> Students will prepare a final presentation with a slidedeck on their project as well as write a blog post detailing their project and how they made it from start to finish.
