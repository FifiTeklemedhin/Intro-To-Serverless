*Managing a server is pretty complicated, and building with serverless architectures simplifies this process. As a student, mastering serverless functions can help you to build projects that solve real-world problems by integrating APIs, constructing user interfaces, and analysing data. Javascript is the core language of this course - one of the most in-demand languages to learn in the industry.*

### **Week 1** - Get Started with Azure Functions!
This week, students build projects to get started with Azure Functions, Cloud Engineering, and Javascript! In addition, they will set up their development environment, familiarizing themselves with various developer toolsg like Github and Postman. 

| Category  | Assignment       | Description                                                                         | Learning Objectives                                                                  |

### **Week 2** - Working with APIs

**Project** - **Emotional Gifs** <br>
Serverless Function that takes a picture from SMS (through Twilio), uses Microsoft Face API to analyze emotion, and sends back a gif that matches the user's expression. 
- Twilio API
- Giphy API 
- Micorosft Face API
- Writing Azure Function

**Challenge** - TwinFinder Pt1 <br>


### **Week 3** - Incorporate a Database
Deep Secrets API
It's a Serverless Function that takes in a text input from SMS (Twilio)/ HTTP Request, stores it into a database (CosmosDB) and returns a random secret as the response.

* Azure Functions
* Twilio
* Implement a CosmosDB database
    * Learn about NoSQL databases and data structures
    * Store data with documents
    * Code functions to work with databases

### **Week 4** - Building a Frontend

Create a frontend for DeepSecrets API
Code a rudimentary frontend with HTML, CSS, and JS for the Deep Secrets API. 

* Code a rudimentary frontend with HTML, CSS, and JS
    * Code and style a page
    * Integrate JS that makes a POST request to the HTTP Triggers
* Visualize emotion data
    * Integrate the data stored in the CosmosDB database
    * Visualize the emotion data retrieved from the Face API

## :zap: Build your Own Project (Week 5-8)

### ✔️ After completing the cabin, students will create their own app with this timeline:
> ### **Week 5** - Brainstorming & Proposals ⛈
> Students will submit a final project proposal which should outline, at a high level, what their project will be. This includes a project flowchart that shows the different components of the project and how they will interact with one another.
> 
> ### **Week 6** - Developing the MVP 💻
> Students will be presenting their MVPs next week and will be working with their instructors and mentors to develop their projects over the course of the next 2 weeks.
> 
> ### **Week 7** - Completing the MVP
> Students should have an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of the final project. This should be a bare bones version of the project with the most basic functionality working.
> 
> ### **Week 8** - Finalizing & Adding Features 🎀
> Students will continue adding features and building their project until it is fully complete.
> 
> ### **Week 9** - Final Presentations 
> Students will prepare a final presentation with a slidedeck on their project as well as write a blog post detailing their project and how they made it from start to finish.
