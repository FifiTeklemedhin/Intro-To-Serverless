## Let me in!

### ✅  Tasks:
- [ ] Add on to the HTTP Trigger in the previous issue to check if the user’s parameter input of “password” equals “letmein”
- [ ] If it doesn’t equal the correct password, the function should return “Access denied.”
- [ ] Place your function URL in a [repository secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) called `HTTP_ENDPOINT` so we can check your function. 
- [ ] Commit the function's code in a file named `letMeIn.js` to the root of the `week1` branch!
